# Rideau Website

This is a website for a company that does not exists, its main purpose was to serve as something I could confidently add to my portfolio as it was entirely built and designed by me.

## What was used for this project?

This project was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React framework for Static Site Generation (SSG), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## What did I practice while building this project

* General Gatsby Concepts
* Animations **without** any third party library such as Green Sock, which is a nice to have, as sometimes the required animations are very simple and adding a third party library just for it may harm performance.
* Graphql queries
* Adding a simple Markdown blog to a Gatsby Project
* Adding custom fonts
* Setting most of the content in `json` files to make the site's content easier to update for non technical persons as no code has to be touched.

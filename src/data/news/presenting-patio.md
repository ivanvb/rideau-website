Since its creation Rideau has been dedicated to provide the best possible service for our customers, this has been the driving force for our astonishing success in the past and we believe it will continue being so for the time being. This leads us to always be checking out what the customers need, what the market wants, but more importantly, what we believe will make our customers happy regardless of the place they will install our products.

## Introducing Patio

Rideau's Patio is our latest addition to our Exterior Blinds. Made from a combination of cotton and polyester, the Rideau is a 3-way flat rotation blind that has the space saving advantages of sliding panels.

These shades are so light that they are easy to move into position. The translucent interior offers a full view out, while the polyester-cotton blends keep glare off of the interior and allow for optimum natural light. Our walk-in shades are perfectly sized for any patio, patios, or balconies.

The Patio comes in a variety of colors, including:

* Sky white
* Cosmic Beige
* Picnic Blue
* Celestial Pink
